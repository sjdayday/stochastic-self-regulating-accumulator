Stochastic Self-Regulating Accumulator

See:  LeeNewellVandekerckhove2013.pdf
   This is an extension of the fourth model.

Estimates parameters for a model of hierarchically adaptive search by generating sets of parameters and checking them against real data values in a self-regulating accumulator model of search.  
At run-time, the model chooses parameters from a distribution around the optimal parameter values.
